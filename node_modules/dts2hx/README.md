# Getting Started
- Install dts2hx in your local project as a development dependency:

    `npm install dts2hx --save-dev`

- Install a module with types, for example `npm install three` 

- Run dts2hx on the node module

    `npx dts2hx three`

    This will generate externs into **.haxelib/three**, to use the externs, add `--library three` to your build.hxml file

- Alternatively, generate externs for all local package.json dependencies with

    `npx dts2hx --all`

- For bonus points, add dts2hx as a postinstall script in your package.json so that externs are generated automatically after `npm install`
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "postinstall": "dts2hx --all"
    }
    ```

See [examples/](examples/) for example projects using popular js libraries

The generated externs use haxe 4+ syntax. See `dts2hx --help` for a complete list of options

# FAQ

- **Difference between `@:jsRequire()` and `@:native()`**

    TypeScript type definitions specify whether or not the symbols are accessible globally (`@:native()`) or via module resolution (`@:jsRequire()`). Many type definitions [include both globally available and modular symbols](https://github.com/haxiomic/dts2hx/blob/master/examples/pixi.js/Main.hx#L2). If a library has global symbols, they will be emitted in a package called `global`. all types in the `global` package use `@:native()` metadata, whereas types elsewhere will use `@:jsRequire()`.

    If your types only use `@:jsRequire` and you want to run in a browser (like the [three.js type definitions](https://github.com/haxiomic/dts2hx/tree/alpha-0.9.0/examples/three)), then you can use a bundler. I recommend [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) over webpack and others because it has by far the best performance (~100 milliseconds bundling time).

    For example, to call a bundler after haxe generates your js file, first install esbuild:
    - `npm install esbuild`
    - Then add a `--cmd` that calls esbuild to your hxml, for example:
    ```hxml
    --js example.js
    --cmd npx esbuild example.js --bundle --outfile=bundle.js
    ```
    
    [Here's an complete example for three.js](https://github.com/haxiomic/dts2hx/blob/cb48748bbc8cc8f34a6768cee41acf13612a70a6/examples/three/build.hxml#L10)

- **Should I publish generated types to haxelib?**

    Ideally dts2hx replaces the need to install externs from haxelib, however if the generated externs are not perfect and require manual fixups you may want to publish a curated version to haxelib. Before you do that please consider opening an issue here noting the fixup required instead â€“ it would be better if dts2hx converted more modules perfectly

- **What makes this different from previous approaches?**

   The idea of generating Haxe externs from `.d.ts` files is not new, [ts2hx](https://github.com/Simn/ts2hx) for instance was started 5 years ago already. However, this turned out to not be viable because it implemented a TypeScript parser in Haxe. The maintenance effort required turned out to be too great since TypeScript is evolving quickly.

   This project takes the _opposite_ approach and hooks into the TypeScript compiler API, which simplifies future maintenance a lot.

# Roadmap

dts2hx is currently in alpha release, everything _should_ work but please report any issues!

## Road to Beta
- [x] Automatically handle remapping of js built-in and DOM types to haxe std js externs
- [ ] Index signatures
    - [ ] Classes and interfaces
- [ ] Merge global and modular symbols with `#if global @:native(...) # else @:jsRequire(...) #end`
- [ ] Validation system to confirm all test code compiles
- [ ] Explore converting _all_ typescript definitions in a package, whether or not they're connected to the package's root types
- [ ] Interface extends
    - [ ] Redefined class and interface fields should be renamed rather than removed
- [ ] Other missing types
- [ ] Don't rerun dts2hx if module has already been generated (so that `postinstall: dts2hx --all` is faster)
    - [ ] Only for libs, use haxelib.json information. Regenerate if dts2hx version has changed
- [ ] CLI: Add `--install` option
    - [ ] Automatically try `install @types/{name}` if no types found in main module
    - [ ] Need to select user's correct package manager (yarn vs npm)
- [ ] Generic build types, `Or$N<T0 ... T$N>` and `ConstOr$N<T0 ... T$N>` to enable better type union behavior (and enable enum subsets)
    - [ ] enum subset example from ts compiler: `type ModifierSyntaxKindEnum = Modifiers['kind']`;
- [ ] Copy printer improvements to haxe standard library
- [ ] :star: **Beta Release** *Not perfect but practically useable*

## Road to 1.0
- [ ] Introduce min haxe feature set flag, so we can convert externs for haxe 4.2+ and add #if guards to support older versions
    - [ ] Use system haxe by default
- [ ] Improve comments (typescript compiler doesn't properly expose declaration comments atm)
- [x] When variable fields have function types, convert them to function fields so `@:overloads` are supported and `.call()` isn't required
- [ ] Support native iteration (by handling `iterator` symbol)
- [ ] Advanced type conversions
    - [ ] Support constructor signature in types with `@:genericBuild` abstract
        - If a constructor type is used as a type parameter we can use haxe's `Constructible` type
    - [x] Abstracts to implement Tuples (named fields for array indexes)
    - [ ] Extract hints from JSDoc
        - @nosideeffects -> @:pure (See also https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler)
        - @deprecated
    - [ ] Support union Rest parameters (rare)
- [ ] CLI: Add option to automatically bundle `@:jsRequire()` so a separate bundler isn't required. Maybe a we could use a macro for this
    - Either:
        - bake into the externs
        - include a macro that bundles at compile-time
- [ ] Enable type parameter constraints by default (just needs some type conversion tweaks)
- [x] Haxe-issue: when passing anon objects with `@:native()` fields to externs, `@:native` information is lost
    - [ ] [Hopefully quoted field names will arrive in 4.2](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/9433)
- [ ] Intersection types: rasterize where possible
- [ ] :star2: **1.0 Release**
