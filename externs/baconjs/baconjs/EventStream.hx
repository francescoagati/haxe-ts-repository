/**
	EventStream represents a stream of events. It is an Observable object, meaning
	that you can listen to events in the stream using, for instance, the [`onValue`](#onvalue) method
	with a callback.
	
	To create an EventStream, you'll want to use one of the following factory methods:
	
	- From DOM EventTarget or Node.JS EventEmitter objects using [fromEvent](../globals.html#fromevent)
	- From a Promise using [fromPromise](../globals.html#frompromise)
	- From an unary callback using [fromCallback](../globals.html#fromcallback)
	- From a Node.js style callback using [fromNodeCallback](../globals.html#fromnodecallback)
	- From RxJs or Kefir observables using [fromESObservable](../globals.html#fromesobservable)
	- By polling a synchronous function using [fromPoll](../globals.html#fromPoll)
	- Emit a single event instantly using [once](../globals.html#once)
	- Emit a single event with a delay [later](../globals.html#later)
	- Emit the same event indefinitely using [interval](../globals.html#interval)
	- Emit an array of events instantly [fromArray](../globals.html#fromarray)
	- Emit an array of events with a delay [sequentially](../globals.html#sequentially)
	- Emit an array of events repeatedly with a delay [repeatedly](../globals.html#repeatedly)
	- Use a generator function to be called repeatedly [repeat](../globals.html#repeat)
	- Create a stream that never emits an event, ending immediately [never](../globals.html#never)
	- Create a stream that never emits an event, ending with a delay [silence](../globals.html#silence)
	- Create stream using a custom binder function [fromBinder](../globals.html#frombinder)
	- Wrap jQuery events using [asEventStream](../globals.html#_)
