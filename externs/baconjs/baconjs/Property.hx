/**
	A reactive property. Has the concept of "current value".
	You can create a Property from an EventStream by using either [`toProperty`](eventstream.html#toproperty)
	or [`scan`](eventstream.html#scan) method. Note: depending on how a Property is created, it may or may not
	have an initial value. The current value stays as its last value after the stream has ended.
	
	Here are the most common ways for creating Properties:
	
	- Create a constant property with [constant](../globals.html#constant)
	- Create a property based on an EventStream with [toProperty](eventstream.html#toproperty)
	- Scan an EventStream with an accumulator function with [scan](eventstream.html#scan)
	- Create a state property based on multiple sources using [update](../globals.html#update)
