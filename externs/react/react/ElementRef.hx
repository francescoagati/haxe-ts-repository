/**
	Gets the instance type for a React element. The instance will be different for various component types:
	
	- React class components will be the class instance. So if you had `class Foo extends React.Component<{}> {}`
	   and used `React.ElementRef<typeof Foo>` then the type would be the instance of `Foo`.
	- React stateless functional components do not have a backing instance and so `React.ElementRef<typeof Bar>`
	   (when `Bar` is `function Bar() {}`) will give you the `undefined` type.
	- JSX intrinsics like `div` will give you their DOM instance. For `React.ElementRef<'div'>` that would be
	   `HTMLDivElement`. For `React.ElementRef<'input'>` that would be `HTMLInputElement`.
	- React stateless functional components that forward a `ref` will give you the `ElementRef` of the forwarded
	   to component.
	
	`C` must be the type _of_ a React component so you need to use typeof as in React.ElementRef<typeof MyComponent>.
