/**
	The Accessibility class provides methods for inspecting Chromium's accessibility tree.
	The accessibility tree is used by assistive technology such as screen readers.
	Accessibility is a very platform-specific thing. On different platforms,
	there are different screen readers that might have wildly different output.
	Blink - Chrome's rendering engine - has a concept of "accessibility tree",
	which is than translated into different platform-specific APIs.
	Accessibility namespace gives users access to the Blink Accessibility Tree.
	Most of the accessibility tree gets filtered out when converting from Blink AX Tree to Platform-specific AX-Tree or
	by screen readers themselves. By default, Puppeteer tries to approximate this filtering,
	exposing only the "interesting" nodes of the tree.
